# SloubiChess

**SloubiChess** is a chess database program with focus on:
- *variations* made to look *good* and *readable*, as most chess desktop apps are ugly ;
- *training* by repeating your lines (next big feature, not yet implemented).

It is **not** (yet?):
- a database store of all GMs games ;
- a chess engine, nor a way to interface with chess engines ;
- a way to play chess against someone or something.

## Compile and run

```bash
jai ./src/first.jai
./bin/sloubi-chess -pgn <PGN_FILE>
```
