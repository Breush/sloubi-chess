# SloubiChess

**SloubiChess** is a chess database program with focus on:
- *variations* made to look *good* and *readable*, as most chess desktop apps are ugly ;
- *training* by repeating your lines (next big feature, not yet implemented).

![](./docs/images/alpha-0.0.4.png)
<p align="center">
<em>alpha-0.0.4</em>
</p>

It is **not** (yet?):
- a database store of all GMs games ;
- a chess engine, nor a way to interface with chess engines ;
- a way to play chess against someone or something.
