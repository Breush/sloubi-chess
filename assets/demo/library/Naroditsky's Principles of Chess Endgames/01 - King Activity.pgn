{Hey guys! And welcome to a video, or rather a series of videos, that I'm really
really looking forward to making. So, this is going to be a new series of videos
on two topics within the realm of chess improvement, and these are two very
broad topics that i think do not get enough coverage on Youtube, on Twitch and
chess literature. And as I'll explain the second issue I have with these topics
is that, when they are tackled, I think that it's not done in a manner that's
particularly systematic or conducive to mastery. I'm going to try to take on the
very ambitious task of rectifying that.\nThese two topics are principles of the
endgame and principles of positional play (or just positional positional play,
positional concepts). So over the course of the next couple of months I'm going
to make a bunch of these videos on what I believe to be the most important
endgame principles and themes, and the most important principles and themes
within the realm of positional chess. So, today we're talking about king
activity but we're going to try to cover as many important concepts as possible:
we're going to talk about weak squares, pawn structure, manoeuvers... all of
those nitty gritty in positional chess and endgames that you might be fearing,
or you might think only GMs kind of can do. I'm going to try to demystify and
present in a relatively coherent manner.\nNow the big thing that I'm going to be
doing, and this is really the guiding method behind these videos, that rather
than focusing on just one example and spending 30 minutes on it, I'm going to
try to go for breadth, I'm going to show at the very least four to five examples
per video. Because I believe that, much like tactics, it's not enough to show
somebody what a pin is. You then have to give that person five or six examples
at a minimum, so that they can see the various manifestations and what to look
for. It's not enough just to explain, you also have to drill it down and that's
what I'm going to be trying to do with positional chests and with endgames. I
feel like they can be learned in a very similar manner to tactical themes, and
that is by looking at several examples all at once and really getting that
pattern recognition in place as early as possible. So, with that ambitious goal
in mind, let's begin.\nToday we're going to start with what is perhaps the
single most important principle of the endgame, which is king activity. You must
keep your king active at all costs in the vast majority of end game positions.
We are going to take a look at what exactly that even means and we have some
fascinating endgames ahead of us. The last thing I'll say before we jump in, and
i won't be making this long-winded introduction in subsequent videos on these
topics, but I will be going relatively fast on all of these examples so feel
free to set this up on your own board. Again, I'm gonna try to fit five examples
within 30 minutes so there will be moments within these games where I'm not
focusing on interesting stuff just because it's beyond the purview of what we're
talking about, but that doesn't mean you can't explore things and you can't
learn from these games in ways other than as an illustration of the topic. So,
by all means, feel free to structure this in the way that is most conducive to
your learning.} *

{Let's start with a classic example that I showed all of my students. I feel
like everybody should know it because it is perhaps the single most clear
illustration of how much king activity changes the landscape of an endgame. This
is a game between cuban world champion Jose Raul Capablanca, fourth world
champion, and Savielly Tartakower who was one of the strongest players of the
early 20th century. I believe he was later given the Grand-Master title by FIDE
toward the end of his life. Capablanca and Tartakower have reached a really
interesting endgame. Material is currently equal, five pawns each, but you might
see that White has this protected passed pawn on g5. (And of course we will also
talk about past pawns in a subsequent video.) But if you look a little bit more
carefully you'll see that there is a bit of a problem - White has this
incredibly weak pawn on c3 and a weak pawn on a4. That c3 pawn cannot be
defended by White's rook: although it's on the seventh rank it cannot return to
defend this pawn. It looks like White is not only going to lose this pawn but
the king is going to be tossed back to the second rank. This g-pawn alone is not
going to decide the game in White's favor (see 35. g6). White could try to hunt
for the d5 pawn (see 35. Rd7) but that kind of loses focus.\nBut it turns out
that, in this position, White is winning with an absolutely brilliant manoeuver
- one of my favorite endgame manoeuvers. Capablanca realized that a, b and c
pawns do not matter. The only thing that matters is the fact that, after black
takes on c3, White's king is going to be tossed back to the second rank and that
cannot be allowed. Capablanca thought about it and realized the king actually
has a pathway toward black side of the position where he can support this
crucial passed pawn on g5.}

point here is that the king is going to walk up through h5 to g6 or through an
alternate path that I'm about to reveal. Once the king gets into the black side
of the board it's going to be so much easier to push this g5 pawn. White's king,
rook and pawn are going to overwhelm Black's rook because Black's king, unlike
its counterpart, is completely cut off along the eighth rank. Watch what
happens.} 36... Rf3 37. g6 {37. Kh5 was possible but Capablanca finds an even
more efficient way of getting the king straight into the heart of Black's

pawns that he wants.} {[%csl Bf6]} {[%cal Bh4f6]} 37... Rxf4+ {He does, he takes

great things about having your king active in the endgame is that almost all
pawn endgames are going to be winning, when there is such a disparity in king
activity. Normally if Black's king was on b4 or d7 the game would end in a draw
but because White's king is so active this endgame, it is an elementary win. The
simplest way to win being to slide the king over to b7 and win all of Black's
pawns. It's like watching Lionel Messi on the soccer field, you feel like the
king was on f6 one second and it's on b7 the other.} 47... Kf7 48. Kc6 Ke7 49.

resigned a little bit earlier, but he resigned here because the d pawn is
entirely unstoppable.\nA relatively simple example but nonetheless it shows the
incredible power of how much activating your king in almost any type of endgame
can totally transform the landscape of the position.} 1-0

{Moving on, we have the following position from Akiba Rubinstein's game. Akiba

Black to play. White has just played the move Rc1, offering a rook trade. A
quick look reveals that Black really cannot refuse that trade (see 24... Rh4).}
24... Rxc1 (24... Rh4 $2 25. Rc7+ {White's rook infiltrates to c7 and all of
Black's pawns fall.}) 25. Kxc1 {Now you might notice that there is a disparity
in the pawn structure. Black's pawn structure is so much better than White's.
But in a pawn endgame, pawn structure might not matter because the position
could get locked up and then the game ends in a draw. The advice that you often
get in these types of positions is to go toward the center, but very importantly
what this game reveals is that king activity does not just mean going blindly
toward the center of the board in any kind of endgame. It means, very mindfully,
and very carefully, charting the right path for the king. The king is capable of
great things but you have to know where you're going and why. If you go toward
the center you're not going to get much done because White's king is right in
time to stop the infiltration (see 25... Kd6).} {[%csl
Rh2,Rf2,Rf3,Re3,Bh7,Bf7,Bg7,Be6]} 25... Kf6 {Instead of going toward the center,
Rubinstein realized that the target square for Black's king is on h3 and that is

29. Kg1 {Rubinstein makes a beeline straight for that h3 square. White's king
barely barely manages to reach g1 but it doesn't matter. Again, look at the
disparity in king activity. That disparity is transformed into a very confident
win with a relatively simple but nonetheless very nice plan. Rubinstein now
realizes that what he needs to do is clear: it's like when you're walking with
an axe and clearing all the trees. He will have to get his king over to g3. What
does that entail? That means he'll have to trade the pawns on h2 and f2 and he
has just the tools to do that because White is totally paralyzed.} {[%cal

promotes, but again all because of the king activity this is not to be feared.}
{[%cal Re5e8]} 41... Kg3 42. e6 f3 43. e7 f2#) 39... Kxg3 {If this isn't in an
illustration of the importance of king activity, then I don't know what is. It's
all about charting the right path, particularly in pawn endgames do not go
blindly toward the center: try to find the right target square for your king and
get the most mileage out of it.} {[%csl Re4]} {[%cal Bg3f3,Bf3e4]} 0-1

{Speaking of mileage, let's take a look at one of my games from right about 12
years ago against Benjamin Bok. Neither of us were grandmasters at the time. I
think this is also good illustration of the fact that, even in queen endgames,
even when your opponent has an active queen, it doesn't matter: the king can
overpower even the queen in the right kind of situation.\nSo we have a queen
endgame, material is equal: six pawns, a piece. But if you look carefully at the
pawn structure you might notice two things. First is that Black has this very
weak backward pawn on f6 and it's fixed by the pawn on e4. Now, that might not
matter because White doesn't have any pieces left, but that's something to keep
in mind. The second thing, perhaps even more important, is that we have the
potential to create a passed pawn with h4. And I was very tempted to play h4
here. Why didn't I do that? Because after the trade black queen swings back to
the blockading post on h6 and White simply cannot make any progress (see
variation).}

my h pawn, which happens very soon - I call this "rolling out the red carpet":
once the pawn reaches h6, the king will be able to supervise the pawn's progress

that White cannot take on f4: Black gets an unstoppable passed pawn. But you

{So far we've looked at pretty much only endgames, but let's take a look at how
king activity can actually help you turn around a completely lost position.
Sometimes going into a lost endgame is the only way to save yourself from a
checkmating attack. I played this game about 10 years ago against the hungarian
GM Tibor Fogarasi, who played a phenomenal middle game. He was crushing me and I
was forced to give up a piece, and get the game into what seems like a
completely hopeless endgame.\nWhite is literally up a full knight. I don't even
have a pawn for it. And, to make matters worse, White has this protected outside
passed pawn on a3. So, even in a pawn endgame, if White gives up the knight,
it's still going to be lost. I was thinking about resigning here but then I
decided I'll try one last little crazy idea. And that crazy idea involves trying
to run the king up the board as quickly as possible and use my past d-pawn to
create last-ditch counter-play.}

crossroad. I think a lot of people's instinct here would be to drop back to d7
in order not to give up the e6 pawn. What you have to understand, particularly
when you're down material, is that king activity is so much more important than
clinging to a single pawn - not always - but in this case it is.} 3... Kc5 {All

don't usually look for checkmates in the endgame. And in this way, of course it
involves some luck, but I was able to salvage this creative endgame down a
knight against a GM. It's all because I decided as a desperate attempt to
activate my king, and not to keep it passive on d7, to try to cling to my
pawns.} 1/2-1/2

{As our final example I want to take a look at my all-time favorite example. The
first one - the Capablanca game - is my favorite illustration of the importance
of king activity, but this last game is my favorite application of the rule that
you have to keep your king as active as possible in the endgame. This is an
absolute treat.\nThis game was shown to me by my coach, GM Lev Psakhis, who was
playing White against Mark Hebden an english GM. This was the World Junior
Championship in the 1980s, so neither of these players was a GM at the time this
game is played. Psakhis has played an excellent game. As you can see, he is a up
a pawn, he's got a protected and extra passer on b4. And, what's more, he's got
complete and total domination over all sides of the board. Black is entirely
paralyzed. The black queen can't move, because of Qf6+. The black rook can't
move because you drop f7. Basically only thing that Black could do is just go
back and forth from a7 to b6. But the frustrating thing is that it's not enough
to get this, you actually have to win. And winning is hard because we have
opposite colored bishops and the b pawn isn't able to reach b6. b6 is a dark
square and black has control over it. Now, are there any tactics? (See Bxf7 and
c4 variations.)\nEventually Psakhis came up with... - really, I don't think I'm
overstating the case by saying that it's one of the most brilliant endgame ideas
that I have seen. Because it's not the endgame yet, the queens are still on the
board, I would still classify this as a middle game. But what Psakhis realizes
is that one of the weapons at White's disposal is a queen trade, and the way
that White can orchestrate that potentially is to play the move Bc6, and then to
play the move Qd7. (See Bc6 variation.)}

idea. Taking care of your future self, you never know when it might be a good
idea to prevent Black from playing g4.} 48... Bb6 49. Kc4 {And now it's back to
business.} 49... Ba7 50. Kb5 {White has time for Kb5. This is crazy. And what's
crazy about this is that there's no check on b7.} 50... Qe8+ (50... Rb8+ {A very
tempting check and here you see an\namazing line.} 51. Ka6 Rb6+ 52. Ka5 {It
turns out that there are no more checks and black cannot defend the pawn on f7.
The king does it all.} {[%csl Bf7]} {[%cal Bf5f7]}) 51. Bc6 {Now we resort back
to the old idea.} 51... Qd8 52. Kc4 Qe7 53. Qd7 {Now it's time for Qd7 which
we've already discussed. And the dream has come true.} 53... Qe6+ {After the
queen trade the king would walk right up to d5 and overwhelm Black's defense.
Hebden tries to trade on his own terms.} 54. Qxe6 {Psakhis says thank you very
much.} 54... fxe6 55. Rxf8 Kxf8 56. Kb5 {He trades everything. And again king
activity decides the day because the king's gonna walk up to a6 and then White
will either promote the pawn or win all of Black's pawns in the center and on
the king side after forcing the king to walk over to the queen side.} {[%csl
Ba6,Bd6,Be6]} {[%cal Bb5a6]} 56... Ke7 57. Ka6 Bxf2 {We don't care about the f2
pawn that pawn doesn't matter. Absolutely take it.} 58. c4 {Stopping any kind of
d5 shenanigans.} {[%csl Rd5]} {[%cal Rd6d5]} 58... Kd8 59. Kb7 {You do not allow
Black's king to reach c7, then it\nwould be a draw.} 59... Be1 60. b5 Bf2 61. b6
Bd4 {It might seem a little bit difficult to get this king out of the way.
Because, if you go to a7, you're just going to end up being pinned.} {[%csl
Bb7]} {[%cal Bb7a7]} 62. Ba4 {But all that Psakhis had to do is move the bishop
back and now the threat of Kc6 is totally devastating.} {[%csl Bc6]} {[%cal
Bb7c6]} 62... d5 {Hebden tries the last ditch attempt.} (62... Be3 63. Kc6 Ke7
64. b7 Ba7 65. Kc7 {You can promote winning the bishop.}) 63. cxd5 exd5 64. exd5
e4 65. Kc6 {It's very clear that he easily stops the pawn with a bishop on b5.}
{[%csl Be2]} {[%cal Ba4b5,Bb5e2,Re4e3,Re3e2]} 65... Kc8 66. d6 e3 67. Bb5 Bf6
{And now a classic case of two passed pawns kind of overwhelming the defenses.}
{[%csl Bb6,Bd6]} 68. Ba6+ Kb8 {In whichever direction Black go, it either allows
the king to infiltrate, or the pawn to promote.} (68... Kd8 69. b7 {[%csl Bb8]}
{[%cal Bb7b8]}) 69. Kd7 {Notice that the king is leading. You walk it up to e8
and then you'll be able to promote the d-pawn. Hebden resigned in this position.
Just a tour de force, the king does it all in this game. Absolute heroic. So
even with the queens on the board, if you are anticipating a queen trade - I'm
not saying bring your king from e1 to a7 and then get checkmated there - but
notice how even preparing for an endgame can involve bringing the king to the
right side of the board.} {[%csl Bd8]} {[%cal Bd7e8]} (69. d7 $2 {It's going to
be hard to cover the d8 square.}) 1-0

{So to summarize, we took a look at five examples where king activity decided
the game. In the first one, that's the Capablanca game, we understood that it's
not even about the quantity of passed pawns - it's about the quality. And in
order to see the passed pawn through to promotion, king activity is often the
missing link. It's often worth literally three or more pawns. That's what
Capablanca showed.}

{In the second game, we understood that king activity isn't just about bringing
the king to the center (well, sometimes it is) but what you have to do is chart
the right path for the king. You have to understand where the king actually does
the most work. And we saw that Akiba Rubinstein understood that the king belongs
on h3, which allows these king side pawns to march forward and crash the White's
defenses.}

{In my game against Benjamin Bok, we saw that king activity is important even
with queens on the board. And it can be that missing link because it can relieve
the queen of some duties that it simply cannot manage. I walked my king all the
way to g7 helping me create the possibility of a passed pawn, and putting
pressure on f6.}

{Then we saw an example where I was really lucky, but i managed to save an
endgame a full piece down by activating my king at all costs and creating sudden
counterplay against White's passive king.}

{And finally the position we just saw. We saw Lev Psakhis bringing the king to
the queen side into Black's territory, literally in the middle game. He
understood that an endgame was coming and, in that endgame, he would need his
king to be active.}

{Hopefully, even before you watch the video, you probably understood that king
activity was important. But I hope that these examples really sort of bring out
the absolute irreplaceability of the king in the endgame. So remember to use the
king wisely (again, don't get checkmated). I would say that the guiding
principle that is true across all endgames, whether it's a pawn endgame or a
queen endgame, even if there are three or four pieces on the board, is that your
king has to be in the right place. Because the fewer pieces there are, the less
you can afford to have one of your pieces just kind of lounging on a beach.
That's what the king does most of the game, but the moment you sense that an
endgame is near it's time to start thinking about the king and what it can do.
That's our first most important endgame principle and I'll see you in the next
video.}
