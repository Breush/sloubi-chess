information.\n\nUndisputed world champion from 2007 to 2013, Viswanathan Anand
is one of the most fluid and intuitive players in chess history. Where Jose
Capablanca's intuition served him best in the endgame, Anand's serves him best
in the middlegame.\nPlayed in advance of his coming 2013 world championship
match against Magnus Carlsen (though Carlsen would not qualify for several
months), Anand showed in this game the attacking skill that makes him such a
beloved player; particularly 16...Nde5!! sticks in the memory as Black's pieces
burst forth and cannot be contained.} 1. d4 d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nf3 Nf6 4. Nc3 e6 5.

{It's mind over matter in this, the most recent game on the list, as Ding Liren
continually places his pieces en prise to achieve relentless pressure against
the white king, who proves unable to escape the center of the board. The game is
filled with beautiful moves, but it is particularly 20...Rd4!! that makes a
striking impression on the viewer.} 1. d4 Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nc3 Bb4 4. Nf3 O-O 5.

of the finest games of all time against IM Donald Byrne with the black pieces.
Fischer's 11...Na4!! and 17...Be6!! constitute two of the great hammer-blows in

{There is no greater rivalry in chess history than that between Garry Kasparov
and Anatoly Karpov. The brilliant games they have contested could fill a
substantial book.\nThis game from their world championship match in 1985
demonstrates Kasparov at his very best, offering a pawn sac in the opening,
establishing a tremendous knight on d3, clamping down with 21...g5!! and always
performing crisp calculation and tactics.} 1. e4 c5 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 cxd4 4. Nxd4

[White "Garry Kasparov"]

[Result "1-0"]

{Despite losing a historic match to the computer engine Deep Blue two years
earlier, Garry Kasparov was at the height of his powers in 1999, winning
tournaments by big margins and recording the highest Elo rating ever at that
time (2851). Kasparov has a long list of brilliancies to his credit, but this
game is his virtually undisputed masterpiece.\nKasparov vs. Topalov is
everything a chess game should be, a ferocious fight with brilliance from both
players, numerous tactical themes, and a king hunt that drives the king all the
way from one side of the board to the other! It's difficult to imagine any other
game atop this list, but we eagerly await new contenders in the coming years.}

[Result "1-0"]

{Often called the "Opera Game," Paul Morphy's informal masterpiece played
against the Duke of Brunswick and Count Isouard is the first complete game shown
to many beginning and intermediate players. It illustrates the value of
development, centralization, and king safety, but most important, it is the
perfectly concise game to illustrate the beauty of chess. What chess player can
fail to smile at 10.Nxb5!, 13.Rxd7!, and 16.Qb8+!!?\nMorphy won this game in the
midst of his European Tour where he easily defeated the other great players of
his day before virtually retiring from chess to pursue law in New Orleans.} 1.
