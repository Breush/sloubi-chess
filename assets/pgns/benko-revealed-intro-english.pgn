{Welcome to the wonderful world of the Benko Gambit. We'll begin with a quick
run through of the opening moves so that everything is nice and clear.} 1. d4
{White uses his first move to stake a claim for the c5 and e5 squares.} 1... Nf6
{In reply Black develops and gains control of e4.} 2. c4 {Unable to play 2. e4,
White settles for the second best way to build pawn centre and takes hold of the
d5 square.} (2. Nf3 {we'd have reacted the same way} 2... c5 3. d5 3... b5 {More
will be said of this variation at the end of the next chapter.} {[%csl Rc4]}
{[%cal Rb5c4]}) 2... c5 {The first direct confrontation after an initially
peaceful carve up of centre territory. This pawn stab amounts to a challenge to
White's hold on d4, as well as c5 and e5 - three dark squares in the centre. }
3. d5 {White concedes a loosening of his dark squares, but on the other hand he
now has a space advantage and intends to build upon it by setting up a
formidable light square pawn chain in the centre. Everything else being equal,
an advantage in terrain confers greater mobility on a player's pieces and
therefore gives him more chances to find or carry out a strong plan.} (3. dxc5
$2 3... e6 {Black regains the pawn with Bxc5 when he has a lead in development.
} {[%cal Gf8c5]}) (3. Nf3 {A fairly common alternative avoiding the Benko. }
3... cxd4 4. Nxd4 {a line of the English}) 3... b5 {As White is so keen to
prevent b5 in the modern Benoni, what happens if Black plays it straightaway? If
you asked a player of the 1920s what he thought about this move, he would have
replied simply 'it loses a pawn'. If you had asked David Bronstein in the 1950s,
he would have muttered something about the Volga Gambit and a bad endgame.
Today, however, the reply would probably be 'you mean the Benko Gambit? A very
interesting opening'. Yes, we have arrived at the subject of our book: the Benko
Gambit. With 3... b5 Black gets in his favourite pawn move before it can be
restrained by Nc3.} 4. cxb5 *
